# red_black_beauty
The icons I modified for my red-black ubuntu theme

How to setup (for ubuntu):
  - snap *.desktop are located in: /var/lib/snapd/desktop/applications 
  - standard app (and default snaps) in: /usr/share/applications (I searched the files with ls -l | grep -i APPNAME)
  
Edit the entry: sudo gedit APPNAME.desktop

replace the "Icon=" entry with one of the given icons and it will change
  

"gimp" folder contains all files saved with gimp.

"originals" the original icons

"red_black" is the folder where I started to modify the animations etc. this is in progress

ENJOY :)
